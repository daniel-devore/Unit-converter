# Unit-converter
A simple distance (metric or SI unit), energy, and temperature unit converted through C++ coding language.

Each unit conversion is separated into separate files:

  Energy: nrg.cpp and nrg.h
  
  Distance: SI-conv.cpp and SI-conv.h
  
  Temperature: temp.cpp and temp.h

The main file that executes the code is labelled conversions.cpp 
and the input-output files are named io.cpp and io.h.
